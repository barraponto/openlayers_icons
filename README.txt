##Summary

The OpenLayers Icons module allows you to add icons as styles to the Open Layers Styles section. This module looks in the %module_name/images folder for images with the .png extension and adds them automatically as icons.

This alpha release currently ships with google icon packs and legacy icons, but if this becomes a real drupal project, then I will take out the default images, and add in instructions for placing images. 

##How It works

Scans the %module_name/images directory for .png files and makes them into openlayers styles.

##Notes on Compatibility

There are no compatibility issues, only that this uses PH5 and Open Layers.

##Limitations

The only limitations are what the openlayers project has as bugs.

##Dependencies

OpenLayers, Open Layers UI.

##Road Map

@todo - figure out if anything else needs to be done!

##Contacting the Maintainer of This project

Please feel free to contact me via github or drupal.org. My handle is "kirikintha" it's easy to find me. Support requests should allow between 3-5 business days, and I have to reserve the right to push off new features to the next version. My plan is to have quarterly releases, unless there is an emergency bug that crashes everything, which I will do my best to resolve as quickly as I can.

Thank you very much for using my module, I hope it works for you bug free!
